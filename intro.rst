Introduction
============

The mir project
---------------

The mir project is a collection of other projects.  These projects
provide Python packages that all strive to adhere to the policies of the mir
project.  The names of these projects begin with ``mir.`` and the Python
packages that they provide are in the namespace package ``mir``.

Like Python namespace packages, the mir project does not provide its own
documentation or website.  These are instead provided by this project,
mir.eschatology.
